# Tornado Forecasting with Machine Learning (and Fluid Mechanics)

CS480 Research Project, Summer '23

### The basics of what I'm doing here:
- Datasets: [PERiLS_2022 GOES ABI](https://doi.org/10.26023/GQMQ-Q2T1-TB0B) and [PERiLS_2022 GOES GLM](https://doi.org/10.26023/52N0-7C8Q-5J0R)
- Feature engineering:
    - AMVs (Atmospheric Motion Vectors) via [OCTANE](https://github.com/JasonApke/OCTANE)
    - SPOD (Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) analysis via [PySPOD](https://github.com/MathEXLab/PySPOD)
- Prediction:
    - [MS-LSTM](https://github.com/mazhf/MS-RNN/tree/main) (and possibly similar variants)
- Classification:
    - TBD

This repo is primarily (most likely) going to be used for my own personal use in keeping track of things, version control and all that sorta stuff. 

Also, ***everything is currently a work in progress***.
