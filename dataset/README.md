This directory contains an example output dataset, alongside how it should be organized in order to properly utilize it alongside the new custom data loader `load_goes.py` within the MS-RNN framework (in `MS-RNN_experimenting`).

The names of the directories within `example_dataset.zip`, as well as the structure of their contents, such as the file lists, are important for proper utilization from the data loader `load_goes.py`. Keep this in mind if you wish to use the pipeline alongside the MS-RNN framework.
